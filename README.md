# Project Title

Programming Portfolio for Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the portfolio model up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

It helps to have a basic understanding of Python to be able to see how the code operates but useful comments through out should help those not as experienced. 

```
A comment will have a # or """ """ within the code. 
```

### Installing

To run the model please download the files onto a suitable directory on your desktop. 

```
Download and save to the most appropriate directory
```

Within the command line (terminal or mac) make sure python is installed. Once installed redirect directory to where the files are stored.

```
On a mac in terminal this is "cd folder"
```

## Running the tests

Once this folder is the main directory within command line or terminal. You can run python and the model.

```
Run with "python ./model.py" 
```

This will run the program, which must be activated using the model GUI at the top of your screen, if this does not run auto
